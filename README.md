# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-a-learning-system
This project features a PC vs. PC Tic-Tac-Toe game based on "Machine Learning" by Tom M. Mitchell. The evaluation function  𝑉 ^ V ^   learns from self-play, achieving a 95% draw rate after 7000 games. It uses six features to represent the board state, which influence the linear evaluation function over time.
